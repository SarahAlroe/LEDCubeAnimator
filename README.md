# LEDCubeAnimator
LEDCubeAnimator is a simple Unity3D application for creating animations for the ICStation 4x4x4 Arduino Light Cube kit.    
Animations are imported and exported in the same format used in the arduino code from 
[*this emalliab wordpress post*](https://emalliab.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/icstation-4x4x4-led-cube-shield-for-arduino-software/),
allowing quick copy-pasta addition or modification of animations.

The user can import existing animations or create new ones, choose lit LEDs for each frame,  increase or decrease the frame count, and play the animation back before exporting.  

The application can be downloaded for Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux from the [*releases*](https://github.com/SilasAlroe/LEDCubeAnimator/releases) tab, or accessed directly in the browser [*here*](https://silasalroe.github.io/LEDCubeAnimator/). Please note that copy-paste does not work in the web-release because of JS limitations.
